## Download files from S3 Bucket

With this code, you can download all the files stored in your S3 Bucket. This code contains three files:
1. Helper. ipynb
2. config.json
3. main. ipynb

You need to modify the information of the config.json file. Put your AWS secret and access keys in the config.json file and keep all the files in the same folder. Run the main.ipynb file in your Jupiter notebook. All files will get downloaded in the same folder where the data is stored.

Put your comments in the discussion section.

If facing any issues, you can let me know.
